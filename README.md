# qunited-rails

Runs headless QUnit tests with [QUnited](https://github.com/aaronroyer/qunited) in your Rails 3 project.

## Configuration

Add the following to your Gemfile in your Rails 3 project:

```ruby
group :test, :development do
  gem 'qunited-rails'
end
```

The development group is necessary to run Rake tasks without having to type RAILS_ENV=test.

Next run Bundler to install the necessary gems.

```
$ bundle
```

## Running Tests

```
$ bundle exec rake test:javascripts
```

## Dependencies

Tests are run with PhantomJS if available, otherwise Rhino (Java) is used. This means you'll either need to have PhantomJS or Java (version 1.1 minimum) in your path to use qunited-rails.
